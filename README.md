# Story picker - for picky bedtime readers

This project is a major WIP!!!

This is an app that I created for my kids. We are avid bedtime story readers, so I thought it would be fun to have an app that lets us choose a caracter, a place, a theme and then select stories for us.

## Notes

Right now it uses a fork of [guntedex](https://github.com/garethbjohnson/gutendex), which is a simple API that lets you query the open source library [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
In the future, I want to create a RESTApi with [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/), which is an open source ebook management application. I'd like to query the metadata of my own ebook library to feed this app.
